# FlowUIX — HTML‑First, Zero‑JavaScript UI for the Future

FlowUIX is a modern **HTML-first, TailwindCSS-powered UI framework** built for the next decade of web development.  
Designed for **HTMX**, **Alpine**, **FastAPI**, **Python**, **Go**, and server‑driven apps — with **zero JavaScript** in the core.

Lightweight. Flexible. AI‑friendly. A new way to build UI.

## 🌟 What is FlowUIX?

FlowUIX is a next‑generation UI component library based on three principles:

### 1. Zero JavaScript Core  
The package ships **100% CSS-only**.  
You add your own JavaScript (or HTMX/Alpine) when needed.

### 2. HTML‑First & Framework‑Agnostic  
Write pure HTML and apply FlowUIX classes.  
Works with HTMX, Alpine, React, Vue, Django, FastAPI, Laravel, Go templates, and anything else.

### 3. AI‑Optimized  
Clean predictable classes make FlowUIX perfect for AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot.
